## Set-Up
Currently the client secret is handeled via gitignore. Create grocery_organizer/src/core/secrets.py and copy in CLIENT_SECRET = [secret]
The secret can be obtained via written request.

## Test Runs
For the moment I recommend running main.py using PyCharm.


## Upcomming Changes
There are a number of TODOs left in the comments. These focus on feature additions and error checking.
